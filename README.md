Lab 1: Components of Time Series

Dataset: terrorism_deaths.csv

Objective: Analyze the components of a time series: Trend, Seasonality, Cyclic, Irregular.

Methods: Time series decomposition and visualization.

Outcome: Identification of long-term trends, seasonal patterns, cycles, and random variations in terrorism deaths data.

Lab 2: Trend Analysis

Dataset: health_insurance_claims.csv

Objective: Understand and measure the trend in time series data.

Methods:

Graphical method

Semi-average method

3-year moving average

Curve fitting / Least squares

Outcome: Smoothed trends of insurance claims over time to highlight long-term behavior.

Lab 3: Seasonal Variation

Dataset: retail_sales.csv

Objective: Analyze seasonal patterns in monthly retail sales.

Methods:

Simple average

Ratio to moving average

Ratio to trend

Link relative method

Outcome: Quantification of seasonal effects, enabling adjustments and better forecasting.

Lab 4: ARMA / ARIMA Models

Dataset: Same or other relevant time series dataset

Objective: Build and evaluate forecasting models for stationary and non-stationary time series.

Methods:

ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) model

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model

Outcome: Predicted future values and analyzed residuals to check model accuracy.

Lab 5: Moving Average

Dataset: Same as Lab 2 or other time series dataset

Objective: Smooth the time series data to clearly observe trends.

Methods: 3-year moving average calculation.

Outcome: Highlighted underlying trend by reducing short-term fluctuations.
